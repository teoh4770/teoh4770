### Hi there 👋, my name is CK.

Here is my portfolio site: https://cheekianteoh.me/

🔭 I’m currently working on [Pomotama](https://pomotama.netlify.app/), my favourite Pomodoro timer app inspired by [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/). (It's open-source!)

🖥️ I’m currently also working with [HawkHacks](https://hawkhacks.ca/), the official student-run hackathon of Wilfrid Laurier University as a frontend developer. (The number of HawkHacks' applicants are growing fast!)

🤓 Here are some projects I want to get done by 2024:
  - [ ] Pomotama (In progress)
  - [ ] Notion Clone
  - [ ] ...

👉 These are the things that I want to have a better understanding in 2024:
  - React
  - PHP & Laravel
  - ...

💬 If you want to collaborate with me on the open-source project that I'm working on, or if you just want to talk about anything frontend or web development related, just send me a message on LinkedIn. I will definitely get back to you.

⚡ Fun facts:
  - I helped a collaborator of Pomotama complete his first pull request recently, which is awesome.
  - I joined a few online software communities such as [Little Software Planet](https://littlesoftwareplanet.com/) and [Software Developer Comminuty](https://www.skool.com/software-developer-academy) where I met a lot of awesome people 
  - I started to attend a few local tech meetups, which is not as scary as I thought.
