### Hi there 👋, my name is CK.

Here is my portfolio site: https://cheekianteoh.me/

🔭 I’m currently working on [Pomotama](https://pomotama.netlify.app/), my favourite Pomodoro timer app inspired by [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/). (It's open-source!)

🖥️ I’m currently also working with [HawkHacks](https://hawkhacks.ca/), the official student-run hackathon of Wilfrid Laurier University as a frontend developer. (The number of HawkHacks' applicants are growing fast!)

🤓 Here are some projects I want to get done by 2024:
  - [X] Pomotama (90% done, need to implement things that differentiate from the original app)
  - [X] Deadlines (80% done, need to implement things that differentiate from the original app)
  - [ ] Notion Clone

> Note for future self:
>
> When building the app, make sure most of the apps aligned with your curent learning goals.
> 
> Think from the company's perspective, like how the app you build actually aligned with the companie's current value.
>
> A frontend developer is someone who made a conscious choice to build interfaces for the unknown with a laser sharp focus on the end user’s experience.

👉 These are the things that I want to have a better understanding in 2024:
  - [ ] React
  - [ ] Software Testing (ongoing)
  - [ ] PHP & Laravel (ongoing)
  - [ ] Restful API ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8ZUb_Okxro)(CRUD, using existing project, refer to keat's project as a reference, using express, postgres)
  - [ ] Full stack web development (focus more on the frontend side for sure)
  - [ ] Comprehensive understanding of web architecture (while learning Laravel)
  - [ ] Build a complete meaningful app from planning to executing

⚡ Fun facts:
  - I helped a collaborator of Pomotama complete his first pull request recently, which is awesome.
  - I joined a few online software communities such as [Little Software Planet](https://littlesoftwareplanet.com/) and [Software Developer Comminuty](https://www.skool.com/software-developer-academy) where I met a lot of awesome people.
  - I started to attend a few local tech meetups, which is not as scary as I thought.
